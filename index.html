	<h2>What Do I Need For My PC?</h2>
		<p>So many people are confused by what is really needed for a PC. The basic answer is, you need a CPU, Motherboard, GPU(maybe built into Motherboard), Power Supply, RAM, and a Harddrive. There is more to building a computer though! For example computers have all sorts of uses, like Gaming, video editing, internet browsing and office work. Here we are going to break it up in three catogories. Gaming, Productivity and basic needs.</p>

		<li>Gaming!</li>
			<p>So there are many things you need for a good gaming PC. The most importtant part to a good gaming PC is the GPU, because most modern titles utilize the GPU also called the Graphics card. In modern AAA titles the graphics are becaoming more and more complex, so you're gaming PC will utilize every bit of VRAM from your GPU. A GPU I recomend is the GTX 900 series, up to the newer GPUS like the RTX 2000 series. RAM is another important componat of the PC as well, I recomend geting at least 16GB but look at the games you plan to play and see what they recomend you have, and be sure it matches your motherboard as well! You dont want to have DDR3 RAM and have DDR4 sockets. The CPU or as I like to call it the brain of the computer, it powers all of the calculations needed to run a game.</p>
